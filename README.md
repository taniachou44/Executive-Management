# Executive-Management

❄️EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT:

Scenario:
AtliQ Hardwares, a leading computer hardware producer in India with an international presence, is looking to enhance its data-driven decisionmaking capabilities. To achieve this, the company plans to expand its data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, the data analytics manager, emphasizes the importance of both technical and soft skills for these roles and has proposed a SQL challenge to evaluate candidates on both fronts.

Situation/ Task: 
Presented insights on 10 ad-hoc business
requests from a database with millions of rows to the executive
management team to aid in informed decision-making.

Action: 
Queried the database using SQL to extract relevant data
and present the insights effectively.

Result: 
Insights from my presentation have the potential to
significantly reduce overall operational costs by approximately
10%.
